During the Winter 2018 quarter, I designed and implemented a course titled: ***Say What?* An Introduction to Speech Science**. The course aimed to introduce high school seniors to basic concepts in acoustics and speech science. I'm in the process of creating a github repo with the demos used for this course (stay tuned!), but you can see the course description and objectives below:  
  
**Course Description:**  
Speaking is a complex procedure that involves the coordination of more than a hundred muscles
located in the throat and mouth. However, we are able to speak and listen to others
instantaneously with relative ease. This course will introduce students to the factors that shape speech perception and production. By analyzing and transcribing speech samples from
themselves, TV shows, and other sources, students will quantify sound structure of everyday
speech. After this course, students will be familiarized with components of speech and the
International Phonetic Alphabet, and will use this awareness to be stronger verbal communicators.  
  
  
**Course Objectives:**  
Upon completion of this class, participants will be able to:  

1. Identify components of speech perception and production.  
2. Connect specific speech sounds in English to particular anatomical and respiratory
movements.  
3. Apply speech science concepts to everyday communication.

### Resources for Phonetics & Speech Science  
  
I love thinking of new ways to teach phonetics and develop proficiency in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Here are some external resources I share with my students:  
  
* [IPA Chart & Keyboard](http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/)  
* [IPA Chart with Sounds](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)  
* [IPA Arcade Games](http://www.academic.muohio.edu/the233/ipaarcade/description.htm)  
* [IPA Version of the addicting "2048" game](http://ibleaman.github.io/geminator/)  
* [Pink Trombone - A fun way to play with articulators](https://dood.al/pinktrombone/)
