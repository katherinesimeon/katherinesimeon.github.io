## About Me  
  \  
I am a PhD Candidate in [Communication Sciences & Disorders](https://communication.northwestern.edu/departments/csd/about.php) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). I work in the [Hearing & Language Lab](http://hll.northwestern.edu/) with Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub. My research investigates how prior experience with sound and language impacts real-time language processing in children and individuals with hearing loss. I get excited about linguistics, cognitive science, phonetics, speech perception, education, and a lot of other things too. 
  
  
On campus, I am president of [Graduate Women Across Northwestern](sites.northwestern.edu/gwan). In and out of the lab, I an R enthusiast and co-organizer/webmaster for [R-Ladies Chicago](https://rladieschicago.org/).
